        This project called zoo is done on a course called React Basics at
        Business College Helsinki during November-December 2023. It shows you
        pictures of animals. The app has four different pages: home, animals,
        birds and about. Animals page has animals other than birds and birds
        page has only birds. You can search animals by name, remove animal cards
        and increase and decrease the amount of hearts given for animals. In
        this project I learned how to make React routing and how to combine
        different React components into one application.
